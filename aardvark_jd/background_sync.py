*Hand the remote mirroring to a detached process, and record what happened*

A mutating command mirrors the tree out to Google Drive, Todoist and
craft.do, and measurement put `av add_project` at 30.7 s against a 500 ms
target - 29.9 s of it network, across services in a fixed order with no
single dominant offender left to optimise away. So the mutating commands
now do their local work, spawn `av craft_sync` in a new session, and
exit. See `docs/adr/0001-mutating-commands-hand-sync-to-a-detached-process.md`.

Three mechanisms live here:

- **The spawn.** `spawn_detached` starts `craft_sync` - which already runs
  `gdrive -> todoist -> craft` in the mandated order - in its own session,
  with its streams at `/dev/null`, and returns immediately. One spawn of a
  command that already exists, and so no new sync code path.
- **The lock.** At most one sync runs at a time, held by a lockfile beside
  `aardvark.db` inside `00_INDEX🗂️` (per-system by construction, and
  per-machine for free because `dropbox_ignore` excludes that directory).
  A mutation arriving while a sync runs sets a **pending flag** rather than
  starting a second writer; the running sync re-checks it on completion and
  goes round again. Not a queue - a whole-tree repair subsumes every
  mutation made during the previous run, so one slot is enough and the loop
  drains as soon as the user stops typing.
- **The drift marker.** The process that would have reported a failure has
  exited, so each mirror's outcome is recorded in `sync_drift` instead
  (`db.record_sync_success` / `db.record_sync_failure`), `browse` renders
  it, and the next command prints a one-line warning.

**A stale lock is the worst available failure on this map** - it would stop
syncing silently and permanently, fixed only by deleting a file the user
does not know exists. So the lockfile carries a pid and a start time, and
is treated as stale when the pid is gone, with an age cutoff as a backstop
against pid reuse. That cutoff is *derived from* `http_retry`'s per-run
backoff budget rather than chosen separately: it must exceed the longest
legitimate run, or a healthy sync has its lock stolen mid-flight.
